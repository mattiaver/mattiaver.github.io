        <h4>Why this topic?</h4>
        <p>
            I'm definitely not an expert in blockchain. I can even say, I don't know anything about
            it. Nevertheless, I find it very interesting to learn new things and I want to grab this opportunity
            to learn something new about a technical topic. I choose for blockchain because we all know the march of
            bitcoin and the
            other altcoins. I want to know how it works and which technology drives them.

            Note: if you find some information that isn't correct, please let me know. It only helps me to understand
            things better. :)

        <h4>Why is blockchain invented?</h4>
        <p>
            For that we need to look at cash money. Every dollar is marked by a centralized authority. This
            makes it possible for an authority
            to keep track of everything. This means that the authority has also all the power, because they can keep
            track of the records.
            If they want to print extra money, they can just do it without anyone knowing it.

            This is the reason Bitcoin was born. It removes the need of a centralized authority, because everyone can
            keep track of it. Decentralization reduces the risk of
            fraud. Bitcoin applies the block chain technology. This technology has four important elements:

        <ul>
            <li class="lijst"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/bitcoin.png" alt="picture bitcoin"/>It needs a peer to peer network: open for anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li class="lijst"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/bitcoin.png" alt="picture bitcoin"/>Cryptography: this one is important for the safety. If everyone can particpate, also bad actor can do
                it.
            </li>
            <li class="lijst"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/bitcoin.png" alt="picture bitcoin"/>Consensus algorithm: Not everyone can just add a block to the blockchain. First there needs to be a
                proof of work. Only if the computer
                solves a math problem first, it is allowed to add a block to a blockchain.
            </li>
            <li class="lijst"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/android/24/000000/bitcoin.png" alt="picture bitcoin"/>The last element is punishment and reward: everytime someone writes a new page, a reward is given as
                coins.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section3">
        <h4>Transactions and security </h4>
        <p>
            It would take a long time if every single peer needs to approve the transaction.
            How it works is that if the transaction gets approved by 51 procent of the peers,
            then it is considered final.

            Suppose a malicious person wants to add or change a transaction, then he will have to obtain more than 50
            percent of the computing power of the blockchain network.
            The more people are connected to the blockchain network, the safer the transactions are stored.
