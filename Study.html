            Despite my young age, I already did several studies.
            The first study after high school was primary teacher. I thought it would be easy and fun to entertain
            the
            children. Beside who doesn't want
            extra vacation? In my first year I noticed that children can be annoying creatures.
            It wasn't the job for me, but my mom pushed me and I completed my first bachelor.

        <h3 class="kopgrid2"> Applied psychology</h3>
        <p class="tekstitem2">
            After my previous study, I wanted to do something different.
            I thought psychology would be an interesting choice. So I started with that. The study itself was nice.
            I
            learned a lot of different things about people
            and how you can interact with them. Also, I learned a lot about myself an think patterns. It was a very
            useful study to just develop myself and
            work on my people skills. Despite that I enjoyed the study, I didn't enjoyed my work that much. Not that
            I
            completely hated it, but I didn't see myself working
            in HR for twenty or thirty years. I decided to think again about what I really want to do.

        <h3 class="kopgrid3"> Informatics</h3>
        <p class="tekstitem3">
            I thought about what can I enjoy and what could fascinate me. The thing that I enjoyed the most was
            gaming
            and
            maybe software. I started to look up some coding videos en read some information about informatics and I
            found it very interesting.
            So I started with my third study Informatics. I combined it with my full time job, because I couldn't
            stay
            in school forever.

            At this moment I'm in my first year and it is going well. It's not always easy to combine it with a
            full-time
            job, but I try to plan things well
            and I try to split my first year in two years. The most important thing now is to focus on my new job
            and
            keep the school aside for a moment,
            but I'm going to pick it up as soon as I can.
